It could be done with the native flutter completely, but we have a requirement:
```YAML
Mandatory Technologies to use
- Bloc(https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) for state management (use Cubit)
- Dio (https://pub.dev/packages/dio) for services
- get_it for dependency injection (https://pub.dev/packages/get_it)
- JSON serializable (https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) for serializing
- Routing with Go router
```

As it's not a real project, the .env and .build_template are not .gitignored
